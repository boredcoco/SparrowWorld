# SparrowWorld
## Core requirements
### 3D interactable objects
When you click on some buildings there will be a popup description of them

### Interactable UI
Pop-ups have scroll view enabled

### Runtime updating of materials/shaders
The flickering purple lamp in the middle of the park uses a shader to achieve the "candle flame" effect

### Physics interactions
The third person movement of the sparrow involves the heavy usage of physics

### Usage of C# script
C# scripts are used to facilitate UI interactions and physics interactions

## Bonus requirements
### API
Lorem picsum is used to generate some of the images displayed (https://picsum.photos/200/300)

### Good lighting and use of shaders
Did not do much to the lighting, but wrote some shader code (flickering purple lamp in the middle of the park)
